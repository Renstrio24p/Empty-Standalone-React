    - I prepare all the format inside of this folder
    
      1. CSS 
      2. index.html
      3. php-components - requires hosting server to run backend 
      
-> You can start coding with and do your experiments in "index.js"

    2. index.js

-> You can put all your js files inside of "src" folder along with react.js or you can add folders inside.

    3. react.js

-> After you install all dependencies, run this command

    $ npm run build
    
this command allows you to generate your main.js and execute changes

    $ npm start

this command will start your localhost server
can terminate this job by pressing " ctrl + C " then type "Y".
    
    $ npm run deploy

allows to publish your code to github page and this might take sometimes to propagate.

    $ npm run terminate

to terminate port 9500 for your localhost, this command can be used to terminate your localhost.
if you forgot to close your terminal without terminating "npm start" accidentally.

    There you have it. I hope this helps to run your project in the future.
