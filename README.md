# Standalone React

Standalone React v 1.0.0

I made this component to make your life easier to explore react.

complete standalone react w/o npx create-react-app

- Supports ES6 modules
- Babel components
- React version 18

Note: 
- You may delete main.js to utilized your public and src
- Clear all the caches of your browser if your app doesn't load on github 

- npm run build - to update your code
- npm run deploy - to publish your react project

-> You can put your own folders here inside this public folder
    - I prepare all the format inside of this folder
    
      1. CSS 
      2. index.html
      3. php-components - requires hosting server to run backend 
      
-> You can start coding with and do your experiments in "index.js"

    1. index.js

-> You can put all your js files inside of "src" folder along with react.js or you can add folders inside.

    1. react.js


-> Read "dependencies-npm to make this component package work" 

-> After you install all dependencies, run this command

    1. npm run build
    
    - this command allows you to generate your main.js and execute changes

    2. npm start

    - this command will start your localhost server
    - can terminate this job by pressing " ctrl + C " then type "Y".
    
    3. npm run deploy

    - allows to publish your code to github page and this might take sometimes to propagate.

    There you have it. I hope this helps to run your project in the future.
